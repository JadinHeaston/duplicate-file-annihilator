☐ Rework arguments
     Steal work from Sync Application (https://github.com/JadinHeaston/sync-application)
☐ Create deleting file function.
     Determine which file should be deleted. Is random good enough?
☐ Allow for other hashing function(s)
     MD5 is probably the best to use, but having the option for something like SHA-512 would be nice.
